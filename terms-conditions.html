                <h4>Database, Application and E-Commerce Development</h4>
                <p>
                    VFIX TECHNOLOGY cannot take responsibility for any losses incurred
                    by the use of any software created for the client. Whilst every
                    care has been taken to ensure products are problem free and
                    accurate, the ultimate responsibility lies with the client in
                    ensuring that all software is functioning correctly before use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where applications or sites are developed on servers not provided
                    by VFIX TECHNOLOGY, the client is expected to provide or seek any
                    information, additional software, support or co-operation
                    pertaining to the server required in order for the application to
                    be correctly developed. Where large applications are to be
                    developed, it is the client’s responsibility to provide a suitable
                    testing environment which is identical to the final production
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The client is expected to test fully any application or
                    programming relating to a site developed by VFIX TECHNOLOGY before
                    being made generally available for use. Where “bugs”, errors or
                    other issues are found after the site is live, VFIX TECHNOLOGY will
                    endeavor (but is not obliged to) to correct these issues to meet
                    the standards of function outlined in the brief.
